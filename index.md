      I am a 6G communications researcher and a Ph.D. candidate at the Intelligence Networking Lab, Yonsei University, South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Chan-Byoung Chae. Currently, my research focuses on 6G MIMO, satellite and UAV communications, and artificial intelligence. I received my B.S. degree from the School of Integrated Technology at Yonsei University in 2019, where I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

<p class="main-text"> I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Chan-Byoung Chae. My research has covered diverse wireless communication systems, including UAV/satellite communications and massive MIMO. I am currently exploring site-specific AI models, digital twins, and cross-layer intelligence toward AI-RAN architectures. </p>
